# SASL

SASL is a way to login to your NickServ account automatically whenever you join the IRC network. On this page, we link to instructions for setting up SASL no matter what client you're using!

If you're using an IRC bouncer to connect to a network, you should setup SASL on the bouncer and **not** on your IRC client.

Bouncers:

- ZNC

Clients:

- AdiIRC
- IRCCloud
- mIRC
- Textual
- WeeChat
- Colloquy
- irssi

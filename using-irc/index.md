Hey there! This section starts off going over what IRC is, how it works, and how you can chat with it. After that, I'll be going through software you can use, how to find decent communities, and hopefully giving all sorts of useful guidance when it comes to actually using IRC day-to-day.

If you have any questions or issues that aren't covered by the IRC Compendium, feel free to add an issue to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/ircdocs/compendium/issues), talk to me in `#ircdocs` on Freenode, or email me at <a href="mailto:daniel@danieloaks.net">daniel@danieloaks.net</a>

Right-o, let's get stuck into it!

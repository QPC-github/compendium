# The IRC Compendium

_A Guide to Internet Relay Chat_


## What is this?

This is an online guide that goes through IRC from top to bottom. Every nook and cranny that I think is worth knowing, from getting to know the chat system overall, using it day-to-day, to running a network and building your own IRC software.

Hopefully it should end up being a useful resource for users, devs, and everyone inbetween.

So you'd like to write software that interacts with IRC? Great!

IRC's a super simple protocol that's easy to get started with. However, there can be some hairy parts that are worth keeping in mind if you want to dig into it deeper.

Before developing with IRC it's good to know how to use it and have some experience with it. If you don't have that or would like a refresher, I'd recommend looking at the [Using IRC](../using-irc/) section.
